I specialise in structural biology and biochemistry of protein post-translational modifications (SUMOylation, ubiquitylation, ADP-ribosylation, phosphorylation), particularly with regards to how they are catalysed by dedicated enzymes and how they impact cellular processes such as DNA repair, transcription, and protein degradation. More broadly, I am interested in all biological processes regulated by interactions between macromolecules. I try to understand these processes at different levels, from atomic to systemic. 

The main techniques that I use are protein crystallography; biochemistry; biophysical methods such as ITC, SAXS, and MALS; electron microscopy; and, increasing, cellular approaches. I like collaborating with chemists, mass spectrometrists, and cellular and system biologists.

I have a subsidiary, semi-professional interest in philosophy and history of science (and some non-professional interests I won't bore you about).
