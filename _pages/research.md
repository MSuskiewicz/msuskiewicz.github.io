I am an independent projet leader and a group co-leader at the Centre de Biophysique Moléculaire, Orléans. I supervise an ERC Starting Grant project with an acronym "SUMOwriteNread", dedicated to molecular mechanisms of a protein post-translational modification called SUMOylation. Additonally, together with Bertrand Castaing, I am a leader of a research group: "Protein post-translational modifications and DNA repair: structure, functions, and dynamics".
