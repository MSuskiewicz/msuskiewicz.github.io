I supervise a project "SUMOwriteNread" dedicated to mechanisms of protein SUMOylation and its functional consequences. The project is funded by a European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant granted by the European Union through their Horizon Europe programme. The project is active from January 2023 until December 2027. Our budget is € 1 493 515.

"SUMOwriteNread" is focussed on a protein modification called SUMOylation. Small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs), discovered about 25 years ago, are members of the superfamily of ubiquitin-like proteins. These proteins become covalently attached to intracellular target proteins, modifying their function, location or stability. SUMOylation plays an essential role in many biological functions including cell growth and migration, tumourigenesis, genomic stability, and infection. SUMOylation typically depends on enzymes called E3 ligases. Few SUMO E3 enzymes have been identified and characterised. The ERC-funded SUMOwriteNread project will fill this gap, identifying the structure and mechanism of action of some SUMO E3 ligases, developing approaches to identify and characterise new SUMO E3s, investigate mechanisms by which the specificity of SUMOylation is achieved, and finally to investigate the functional impact of SUMOylation in terms of triggering new protein:protein interactions.

I also act as a supervisor on a small project funded by La Ligue contre le Cancer, dedicated to the understanding of the cellular consequences of SUMOylation of PARP1, an important DNA damage sensor in human cells and a target of cancer therapeutics. This project is active in 2023 and has a budget of € 25 000.

Additionally, we have several other active small projects related to protein modifications and protein interactions.
