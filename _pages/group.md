Protein post-translational modifications and DNA repair: structure, function, and dynamics
------
I'm very lucky to be a member of the research group "Protein post-translational modifications and DNA repair: structure, function, and dynamics" at the CBM, Orléans, France. Since January 2023, I serve as a co-leader of this group, together with its long-time leader, Bertrand Castaing. A part of the group is implicated in the "SUMOwriteNread" project, which I independently supervise.

The current members of the group (including permanent members, PhD students, and master students), in the alphabetical order, are: Aanchal Mishra, Ana Gil Quevedo, Bertrand Castaing, Franck Coste, Ibtissam Talhaoui, Norbert Garnier, Ophélie Delobre, Sana El Massoudi, Stéphane Goffinont, Virginie Gaudon, Marcin Suskiewicz, Lucija Mance.
