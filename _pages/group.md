I'm very lucky to be a member of the research group "Protein post-translational modifications and DNA repair: structure, function, and dynamics" at the CBM, Orléans, France. Together with Bertrand Castaing, I serve as a co-leader of this group. A part of the group is implicated in the "SUMOwriteNread" project, which I independently supervise.

The current members of the group in an alphabetical order: Bertrand Castaing, Franck Coste, Norbert Garnier, Stéphane Goffinont, Virginie Gaudon, Marcin Suskiewicz, Lucija Mance.
