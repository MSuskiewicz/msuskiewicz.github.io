Protein post-translational modifications and DNA repair: structure, function, and dynamics
------
I'm very lucky to be a member of the research group "Protein post-translational modifications and DNA repair: structure, function, and dynamics" at the CBM, Orléans, France. Since January 2023, I serve as a co-leader of this group, together with its long-time leader, Bertrand Castaing. A part of the group is implicated in the "SUMOwriteNread" project, which I independently supervise.

The current (01/09/2024) members of the group (including permanent members, postdocs, and PhD students), in an alphabetical order (acc. to first name), are: Aanchal Mishra, Ana Gil Quevedo, Bertrand Castaing, El Hadji Cisse, Franck Coste, Ibtissam Talhaoui, Marcin Suskiewicz, Lucija Mance, Norbert Garnier, Stéphane Goffinont, Virginie Gaudon.
