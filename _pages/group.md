Together with Bertrand Castaing, I am a co-leader of a research group "Protein post-translational modifications and DNA repair: structure, function, and dynamics" at the CBM, Orl√©ans, France.

More details about the group, including its current members, can be found at: http://cbm.cnrs-orleans.fr/en/research/research-teams/equipe-aspects-moleculaires-du-vivant/dna-repair-structure-fonction-and-dynamic/
