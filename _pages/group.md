I'm very lucky to be a member of the research group "Protein post-translational modifications and DNA repair: structure, function, and dynamics" at the CBM, Orléans, France. Together with Bertrand Castaing, I serve as a co-leader of this group. A part of the group is implicated in the "SUMOwriteNread" project, which I independently supervise.

The current members of the group in an alphabetical order: Bertrand Castaing, Franck Coste, Norbert Garnier, Stéphane Goffinont, Virginie Gaudon, Marcin Suskiewicz, Lucija Mance.

The group website (not very up to date) can be found at: http://cbm.cnrs-orleans.fr/en/research/research-teams/equipe-aspects-moleculaires-du-vivant/dna-repair-structure-fonction-and-dynamic/
