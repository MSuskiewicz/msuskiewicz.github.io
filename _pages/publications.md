I'll try to update this part in the next weeks, adding one paper a week, together with a short summary (14.09.2023).

  During ubiquitylation and related reactions, ubiquitin or a related modifier is first loaded on a Cys residue in an E2 enzyme, producing an E2-modifier thioester. The modifier is discharged from there onto a Lys residue in a protein substrate, often with the help of an E3 ligase.

  SUMOylation is an essential ubiquitin-like modification. While ubiquitylation relies on numerous E2s, SUMOylation depends on a single one, UBC9, which is therefore the central protein of the pathway. UBC9's highly conserved, with sequence changing little from yeast to humans.

  Since the E2-modifier thioesters are unstable, our goal here was to produce a stable mimetic of human UBC9-SUMO. We used a strategy developed by the great Lima group for the yeast Ubc9, which involves introducing a Lys residue close in space to the active-site Cys93 of UBC9. We describe our attempt at this strategy in detail, and show that SUMO efficiently moves from Cys93 to a Lys placed in the position 129 through an Ala129Lys mutation, forming a stable molecule with SUMO attached 3 Å away from its native position in the UBC9-SUMO thioester.

  We crystallised this mimetic. In the absence of an E3 ligase, it adopts the so-called open conformation, which would likely correspond to an inactive state of the thioester. Indeed, all previous structures of UBC9-SUMO were with an E3 ligase, which stabilised the closed state. Interestingly, in the crystal, the mimetic forms chains via a noncovalent interaction between SUMO from one UBC9-SUMO molectule and UBC9 from the next one. We think such interactions can sometimes form in cells, sterically discouraging the active, closed state of UBC9-SUMO. Another interesting point concerns Cys138, a surface-exposed Cys in UBC9 with unclear function. In our open-conformation crystal structure, Cys138 is close to Cys52 of SUMO and they apparently became crosslinked by DTT. Could these Cys form Cys-Cys under some conditions in cells? There're some other elements to the story. We've put emphasis on detailed description and discussion. We'd be happy if it's useful to the field.

  It's part of a larger line of research where we're trying different biochemical and chemical ways of stabilising SUMOylation complexes. It's the first publication from our SUMOwriteNread project. Our engineer, Stéphane Goffinont, played the first fiddle, with assistance from Franck Coste, Pierre Prieu-Serandon, and the rest of the team.
