I specialise in structural biology and biochemistry of protein post-translational modifications (SUMOylation, ubiquitylation, ADP-ribosylation, phosphorylation), especially with regards to how they are catalysed by dedicated enzymes and how they impact cellular processes such as DNA repair, transcription, and protein degradation. More broadly, I am interested in all biological processes regulated by interactions between macromolecules. I try to understand these processes at different levels, from atomic to systemic. I have a subsidiary professional interest in philosophy and history of science.
