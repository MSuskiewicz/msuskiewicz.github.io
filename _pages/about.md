About
======
I am a researcher at the Centre de Biophysique Moléculaire, Orléans, where I am an independent projet leader and a group co-leader. I supervise an ERC Starting Grant project with an acronym "SUMOwriteNread", dedicated to molecular mechanisms of a protein post-translational modification called SUMOylation. Additonally, together with Bertrand Castaing, I am a leader of a research group: "Protein post-translational modifications and DNA repair: structure, functions, and dynamics". 

I specialise in structural biology and biochemistry. My main research interests involve protein post-translational modifications (SUMOylation, ubiquitylation, ADP-ribosylation, phosphorylation) and protein:protein interactions.
