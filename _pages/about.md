My name is Marcin J. Suskiewicz and this is my personal professional website.

I'm a structural and molecular biologist and biochemist. I work as a CNRS researcher, an independent projet leader, and a group co-leader at the Centre de Biophysique Moléculaire, Orléans. I supervise the ERC Starting Grant project "SUMOwriteNread" dedicated to molecular mechanisms of a protein post-translational modification called SUMOylation. Additonally, together with Bertrand Castaing, I lead a research group, "Protein post-translational modifications and DNA repair: structure, functions, and dynamics". 

I live in Orléans, France, but my roots trace back to Poland. Privately, I have a family, am a lay dominican, and an editor of a Polish online cultural magazine, pismosuma.pl. I like being with family and friends, reading, walking, and tea.
