About
======
I specialise in structural biology and biochemistry of protein post-translational modifications (SUMOylation, ubiquitylation, ADP-ribosylation, phosphorylation), with regards to how exactly they proceed at a molecular level and how they impact cellular processes such as DNA repair, transcription, and protein degradation. More broadly, I am interested in all biological processes regulated by interactions between macromolecules and try to understand these processes at different levels, from atomic to systemic. I have a subsidiary interest in philosophy, particularly of science.

I am an independent projet leader and a group co-leader at the Centre de Biophysique Moléculaire, Orléans. I supervise an ERC Starting Grant project with an acronym "SUMOwriteNread", dedicated to molecular mechanisms of a protein post-translational modification called SUMOylation. Additonally, together with Bertrand Castaing, I am a leader of a research group: "Protein post-translational modifications and DNA repair: structure, functions, and dynamics".
