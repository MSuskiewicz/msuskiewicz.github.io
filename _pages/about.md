Thank you for visiting my personal (but mostly professional) website.

I'm a structural and molecular biologist and biochemist interested in protein modifications and interactions. I work as a researcher at the Centre de Biophysique Moléculaire (CBM) in Orléans. The CBM is a unit of the CNRS (French National Centre for Scientific Research) tasked with research at the interface of biology, chemistry, and physics. It is located on the outskirts of the city of Orléans in the Loire Valley region of France.

At the CBM, I supervise the ERC Starting Grant project "SUMOwriteNread" dedicated to molecular mechanisms of a protein post-translational modification (PTM) called SUMOylation. Additonally, I am a member of a research group, "Protein post-translational modifications and DNA repair: structure, functions, and dynamics", which, since recently, I co-lead together with its long-time leader Bertrand Castaing.

I'm affiliated with the ATIP-Avenir programme and Le Studium Loire Valley Institute for Advanced Studies.

I live in France, but my roots trace back to Poland. I completed my scientific education and training mostly in the UK (my studies and then a postdoc in the Ivan Ahel lab) and Austria (PhD and a postdoc in the Tim Clausen lab). 

Privately, I have a family, I'm a lay dominican, and I serve as an editor of a small and very irregular Polish online cultural magazine, pismosuma.pl. I enjoy being with family and friends, reading, walking, and tea. We live in the Saint Marceau district of Orléans and go to the local parish there.
